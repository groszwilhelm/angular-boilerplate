# Webtech & Dragons Client

### Run the projct

- Install dependencies: **npm install**
- Run development server: **npm run start**

> These commands can be run by changing the directory to the client as well
> We have a root package.json that has commands to access both client and server scripts so no directory change is needed 😎

### Build source code in order to be served in production

- Run the production build: **npm run build:prod**
- Start the production server to serve the static files: **npm run serve:prod**

TODO: Would be great after we test it on a production server to addapt the deployment and only deploy the server script and dist directory 😁

In case of 🔥🔥🔥 contact: webtech&dragons team 😁
